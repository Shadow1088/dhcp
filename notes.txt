nodes have arp function which helps them learn their neighbors mac, however
they should also be able to build their mac table based on frames that are passing through them



as far as I understand - push and pop encapsulates all things from affecting other -
for example "stroke"



connections work like this:

wait for first selected node
draw line between node1.x, node1.y and mouseX, mouseY
wait for second selected node
add the connection
